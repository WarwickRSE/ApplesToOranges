v 2.1.2 -> v2.2
* Customisable unit output strings (for fundamental and compound)
* Element-wise getters (by copy and by reference) retaining units
* More developer debug tests and warnings
* Developer docs

v 2.1.1 -> v2.1.2
* Add missing equality operators on tensors
* BUGFIX - stream reading was not opposite of writing

v 2.1 -> v2.1.1
* Small fixes to constructors
* Minor fix on GCC toolchain - multiple definition removed

v 2.0 -> 2.1
* Adds is_unitchecked, is_unitchecked_v and is_unitchecked_numeric_v type deduction
* Adds ability to read from a stream (assuming ST has this)

v 1.5 -> 2.0
* Adds remaining 4 base units, giving all 7. For backwards compatibility the general type is now UnitCheckedTypeFull, and UnitCheckedType remains an alias for the 3 unit version (L, M, T)

v 1.4 -> 1.5
* Alternative normalization idiom (returns, not in-place)
* BUGFIX(ish) - close loophole allowing construction from wrong types
* More constexpr designations
* Identity construction (1, (1,1,1) and (1,0,0),(0,1,0),(0,0,1))
* Transpose (implemented for tensors only)
* Outer product of two vectors (same dim only)
* Refactor of test code to make clearer and improve commentary

v 1.3 -> 1.4
* Failing test mode to show things that will not (as is desired) compile
* cbrt and nthroot functions
* BUGFIX - pre 20 resolution of power function
* BUGFIX - printing of Tensor values
* constexpr constructors to allow use in constexpr contexts
* BUGFIX - wrong include style used ('<' for '"')


v 1.2 -> 1.3
* Adds casting
* Adds powers and sqrts
* Adds special function examples
* Internal refactoring and cleanup

v 1.1 -> 1.2
* BUGFIX on fractions (no effects on current functions)
* Test of inverting a quantity

v 1.0 -> 1.1
* Cross product and Normalize (in place) functions
* Adds get for dimensionless values

Pre v1.0
Incomplete function, interfaces subject to change
